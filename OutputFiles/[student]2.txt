Test Essay 2 

[student] [student] 
[student] 

 

Introduction 
 

 
Two years ago [student] [student] fancied himself untouchable. He was CEO of 
Papa [student]’s, the nationwide pizza chain he founded, and served as its 
ubiquitous TV pitchman. The business had grown to 5,000 stores and $1.7 
billion in revenue, and his fortune tallied some $950 million. “We see news 
story after news story of CEOs who run companies into the ground,” 
[student] scoffed in his 2016 autobiography, which chronicled the business’ 
rise.  

Then [student] began to do exactly that. The world already knows of his two 
biggest flare-ups. Last November, he criticized the NFL’s handling of national 
anthem protests, calling the whole affair a “debacle.” Papa [student]’s shares 
crashed 11% in hours and kept falling, [student] lost his CEO title and 
franchise sales dropped an estimated 5% or more. Then, in July, while 
reporting this story, Forbes learned that [student] had used the N-word and 
made other controversial remarks on a conference call two months prior. On 
July 11, the day that news broke, he resigned as chairman.
